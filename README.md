# XYZ Reader
This app fetches eBooks in JSON format, parses the JSON and displays the book's title, author, date, image and content.

App includes the following material design components:
* Coordinator layout with AppBarLayout and CollapsingToolbarLayout.
* Parallex layout collapse mode for toolbar and book cover image.
* Button animation.
* Floating action button (FAB) with state list animation.
* Responsive design by optimizing layout and text for different screen sizes and layout orientations via the use of dimensions.

This is one of my projects for the [Android Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) course on Udacity.
